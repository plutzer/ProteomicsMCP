DETECTING HOMEOSTATIC PHOSPHORYLATION MECHANISMS IN PROTEOMICS DATA

When investigating phosphorylation sites using CPTAC data, always compare both NORMALIZED (phospho/protein) and RAW (absolute) phosphorylation levels against the corresponding protein abundance. A hallmark signature of homeostatic regulation is when normalized phospho shows strong INVERSE correlation with protein levels (r < -0.6, p<0.001 across multiple cancer types), while raw phospho shows positive or neutral correlation with protein. This pattern indicates the cell is adjusting phosphorylation stoichiometry (% of protein modified) to compensate for protein abundance changes. To validate homeostasis: (1) check if raw phosphorylation (not total protein) correlates with downstream target expression, (2) verify the inverse stoichiometry pattern is consistent across multiple tissues/cancers, and (3) look for weak protein-output correlations despite the protein being functionally important. This suggests post-translational modification is tuning specific activity to buffer against expression noise. When this pattern emerges, interpret the phosphorylation as an ACTIVITY RHEOSTAT rather than a simple on/off switch, and consider that published annotations based on acute perturbations may not reflect steady-state regulatory logic. Always query both normalized=true and normalized=false in correlation analyses to detect these homeostatic mechanisms.
